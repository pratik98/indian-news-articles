#CaptainSpeaksToArnab

Captain Amarinder Singh, Chief Minister of Punjab since the Congress swept the state in the 2017 assembly elections, has tendered his resignation after a months-long spat with his once-minister Navjot Singh Sidhu. Captain Amarinder, in this blistering and explosive interview with Republic Media Network's Editor-in-Chief Arnab Goswami, spoke his mind on all those matters over which he had maintained a studied silence for a long time. From Sidhu's 'incompetence' to the Congress 'humiliating' him despite his many decades of loyalty and service to the party, to his declaration to contest the Punjab elections, Captain Amarinder Singh has left nobody in any doubt that he remains a pivotal player in the state's politics.
