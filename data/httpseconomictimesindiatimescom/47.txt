In view of the Supreme Courtâ€™s order of Gajendra Sharma, we are not allowed to classify customers under NPA which were not NPA as of August 31, 2020. However, we have considered them as part of our Stage 3 assets. Further, you can see that we have adequate provisioning. If you see the overall provisioning that we have created, it is substantially higher than what we normally provide, and typically our provision on the book is around 60 basis points whereas as you can see now we are at about 1.4 per cent of the book as provisions. `
