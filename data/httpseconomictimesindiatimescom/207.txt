Srinivasan CR Chief Digital Officer, Tata Communications is accountable for all the digital and security strategies at Tata Communication. This includes the transformation of the current process in both business and back-end.In an interview with ETCISO.IN, Srinivasan CR lays down the secure digital strategy for Tata Communications.Digital transformation emphasizes on positioning the customer at the center of the digital journey and delighting the internal and external customers.We are significantly focusing on improving the customer experience, automating the business processes by digitizing the customer interfaces and simplifying the internal processes to reduce the time to respond the customer.Security is an integral part of this digital journey, we design the infrastructure and application security right from the white-board. Unless the security is placed first, we cannot achieve the successful transformation, hence we start incorporating the security controls right when we begin with testing and implementing the technology.Modern technologies are emerging to be open, API driven and connected, thereby, it is mandatory to integrate rules with the newer technologies. The framework needs to be controlled and flexible at the same time to accommodate the evolving technologies.The pace at which technology is changing, it is important that organisations assist the risk constantly, rather than just a periodic exercise.At Tata Communications, security is reviewed at every modification that is made in the infrastructure and application, the impact on the security controls are evaluated cautiously. We ensure that the security controls are agile, and ensures that those controls get the adequate updates to match-up the looming technology.Digital transformation is the heart of any infrastructure and the need here is to ensure that infrastructure is available 100 %. Thereby, infrastructure requires scaling, it must live up to the peak demands and should stand up to the security threats. Hence, we in-cooperating security as we built the applications, which makes the deployment robust and combines with our ability to do consistent network security and end to end integrated infra testing.As we lead the transformation we are looking at the microservices architecture.The technology updates will keep on increasing, which requires an agile process for moving the application from the development stage to the userâ€™s expectancy page.At large corporates like Tata Communications, securing huge data means starting from the quality check, provide adequate role-based access control and persistently monitoring the life cycle of the data.It is critical to understand the classification of the public, private and confidential data and the data processing policies within the company.
