By Dhrumil DhakanThe threats of cyberattacks are imminent despite a security strategy that a firm might have and during the pandemic, the threats become significantly more difficult to deal with, especially with remote working in place.While precautions, such as firewalls and filters, to deal with outside attacks are implemented continuously to deny access to important data to outside forces, it is the next level of threats that pose a risk to companies that are insider threats.“Now, let’s consider if some of my people who work for my organization and they want to take out my data, that is the biggest challenge, again they want to implement some insider threat intelligence,” Naseem throws light on the problems faced by firms.To counter insider threats, the firm uses the help of technologies such as MDM policies, DLC, CasB as such that protects outgoing data from the user’s device by alerting the organization on it. The MDM solution safeguards company data by retracting the information from the private phones of the employees that have since left the company.“So, MDM basically creates a sandbox, if you consider your laptop, it has the C, D, E Drives, so if your company push the MDM policy, your laptop or your phone will create a sandbox, a container, or a similar kind of drive, and when you leave the organization, the organization can delete the complete drive, so you will not be able to take out the data” he explains the utilization of insider threat intelligence tech.In the pandemic, the parameters for who’s an insider and an outsider became blurry and it became difficult to who is in the team, so to tackle this problem, they employed a hybrid model that requires the person logging in to use their office User ID - Password, office laptop and are logging from a certain VPN IP. This zero-trust infrastructure was essential in their path to protecting their data.The cyber security team also uses the Google Context Aware Access for its employees that constantly checks the device ID, serial number, and operating system by syncing the account at regular intervals to decide whether or not to grant access to the user.Furthermore, the firm needs to protect the data from those who have administrative rights and can gain easy access to the information with malicious intent, so to protect the data from such causes, there’s an evolving tech named TSocks.“They do some level of marking or leveling to identify all these admin people, and they have a special login, so whatever I do, it’s completely locked,” Halder says on how the data is protected from the admin too, “SO, there will be one team who will continuously be reviewing whatever I am doing, am I authorized to do these things or not,”Not just insider threats, but even brand reputation is something that the cybersecurity team has to be aware of when it comes to risk management when it comes to cases such as duplication or fraud.“What we usually do, we have a certain kind of software called Spider network or Spidercode, so what they will do, there are certain companies that also have similar kind of product, they’re basically continuously searching, What is Acko? How many things are in Acko’s name? You publish something with Acko’s name, it will show up in my dashboard that this is what is available on the internet on Acko,” he broke down on the use of Spider network for the firm. He also stated that the system also picked up on the nearest keyword people use to Acko.“If you’re not into digitalization, you will not be able to sustain in this world,” He concluded on the importance of innovation in the cyber security space.
