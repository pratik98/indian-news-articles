India’s audit watchdog National Financial Reporting Authority ( NFRA ) has found the appointment of EY ’s audit affiliate SRBC & Co LLP as statutory auditor of IL&FS Transportation Networks (ITNL) “illegal” and “void”. The accounting regulator said this in its Audit Quality Review report of the statutory audit of IL&FS Transportation Networks for the financial year 2017-18.“The initial appointment of SRBC & Co LLP, and the continuation of SRBC & Co LLP, as statutory auditor of ITNL, was prima facie illegal and void,” the NFRA said in a release.ITNL’s financial exposure to its subsidiaries, associates and joint ventures amounting to Rs. 3,346 crore was “not properly valued” as per the applicable Accounting Standards, it further said.The Company’s losses during 2017-18 were understated by at least Rs 2021 crore on account of unjustified reversal of Expected Credit Loss (ECL) on loans given to the Special Purpose Vehicle and on trade receivables, and due to incorrect impairment valuation, the NFRA said.This is excluding the impact due to incorrect treatment of the letter of comforts amounting to Rs 2654 crore, which should have been correctly treated as financial guarantees as per the accounting standards, the effect of which on profit/loss is not quantified, it further said.SRBC’s partner has “failed to report material misstatements” known to him to appear in a financial statement with which he is concerned in his professional capacity and “has not exercised due diligence” to obtain sufficient information to objectively evaluate the significant judgements of the Engagement Team and conclusions reached by them, the NFRA made a critical observation.Further, the audit firm has failed to maintain documents as per SA 230, and the integrity of the audit file is questionable due to tampering and inconsistency pointed out at several places in the Audit Quality Review Report, the NFRA said.“Over the past two years, we have co-operated fully with NFRA and provided the requested information. We are disappointed with the conclusions in the Audit Quality Review report of ITNL for FY2017-18. SRBC & Co LLP (SRBC) had performed the audit as per the applicable standards and highlighted the issue relating to going concern in our limited review report for the June 2018 quarter. We are presently doing a detailed review of the report," the SRBC and Co LLP said in a statement.
