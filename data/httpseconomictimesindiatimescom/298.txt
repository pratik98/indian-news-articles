Vodafone Idea has named its enterprise head Abhijit Kishore as its new chief operating officer effective November 1, to replace Ambrish Jain who will be retiring at the end of October. Arvind Nevatia , currently Cluster Business Head – Karnataka & Andhra Pradesh, will take over as Chief Enterprise Business Officer, effective November 1, the telco said in a statement Friday."Ambrish has had a significant impact on not just the evolution of the company, but the Indian telecom sector. Vi has great depth in its management talent pool and practises the philosophy of providing career growth opportunities to our internal talent," Ravinder Takkar , MD of Vodafone Idea, said.The development comes at a time when India's only loss-making private telecom company is trying to find its mojo back following the announcement of a relief package by the government. The telco believes that the package will provide "short term" financial relief and said that the underlying structural reforms will in the long term further strengthen VIL’s operations.In a setback to the company however, the telecom department on Thursday issued a notice , asking it to pay Rs2,000 crore in penalties within three weeks for flouting licence conditions by denying Reliance Jio Infocomm adequate points of interconnection (PoIs) in 2016, which affected the quality of services. This will further add to the telco's Rs1.6 lakh crore statutory dues.
