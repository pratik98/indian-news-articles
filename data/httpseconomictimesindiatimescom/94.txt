NEW DELHI: CoLive , a Bengaluru-based co-living startup, plans to add 15,000 beds by 2019-end, said Suresh Rangarajan K , founder of the company. In conversation with, Suresh talked about the change happening in the co-living sector and its plan to thrive in the industry.Started in 2016, CoLive currently maintains 10,000 plus beds and has about 125 employees. The company raised $3 million in 2018 and operates in Bengaluru, Chennai and Hyderabad . "We started our operation in Hyderabad in February 2019," said Suresh.The company works as an operator and generates its income from rent, service charges and handling charges from the tenants. For the supply, it works on 'minimum guarantee rent and revenue sharing' model with landlords and builders. "The rent is shared between builders/landlords and us in 80:20 ratio (on an average)," said Suresh.In 2018, the company generated a revenue of Rs 11 crore and currently is at a run-rate of Rs 40 crore. Suresh says that they are looking to break-even by the next financial year. According to him, they have seen three times growth in the last six months. In August 2018, we had less than 3,000 beds and now in February we crossed 10,000 beds.He feels that there has been a dramatic shift in the co-living industry in the last six months. "Recognition of co-living has increased and more people are now considering it as an option to rent. Earlier they used to search PGs for rent which has now changed to co-living for rent," feels Suresh.This change is when rental values in co-living spaces continue to be 15-20 per cent premium over PGs. CoLive charges Rs 6,500-9,500 for double sharing and Rs 13,000-18,000 for single-sharing depending on the area.People in the age group of 22-35 who are looking to upgrade their lifestyle, especially the migrants coming to tier-I cities, are considering co-living spaces as an option for their accommodation.In coming time, the company plans to target builders offering "assured rental scheme" and is also urging them to build smaller built-to-suit properties. Earlier co-living operators were not established, now that there is much more acceptance for such spaces, builders can look into "buy-to-let" model, feels Suresh.He also feels builder will be able to generate a rental yield of 8-10 per cent instead of 1-4 per cent (depending on cities) that is being currently offered.For him, co-living is a refined form of real estate which is now catching the eyes of private equity players as well and has a lot of scope for all the players involved.
