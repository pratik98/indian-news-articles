Delhi Chief Minister Arvind Kejriwal backed the agitating farmers and urged the Central government to listen to their demands. "This is very sad that on the occasion of Bhagat Singh birthday, farmers had to call for a Bharat bandh. It has been almost a year since the farmers are trying to convince the government. This is an independent India. If we don't even listen to our farmers in independent India, then who will?" said Kejriwal while speaking to the reporters during the Delhi Tourism app launch.
