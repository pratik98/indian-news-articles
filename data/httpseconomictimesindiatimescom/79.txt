The Union environment, forest and climate change ministry has approved the Coastal Zone Management Plan (CZMP) for Mumbai and its suburbs, a move that will boost real estate development in the country’s commercial capital and adjoining areas.The decision is also expected to pave the way for the redevelopment of a large number of eligible housing societies and slums, as these areas can now get a floor-space index (FSI) or permissible development equal to that for the rest of the city.“Mumbai and its suburban areas face the challenge of a large number of old, dilapidated buildings and existing slum dwellings. The redevelopment of these has posed a challenge, as a result of the existing norms,” said Niranjan Hiranandani, national vice chairman, NAREDCO He said the final notification of CZMP for Mumbai will indicate the quantum of land parcels that can be opened up for real estate and construction activities in the city and adjoining areas.The order, once issued by the National Coastal Zone Management Authority, will allow rehabilitation and redevelopment work in these areas and real estate projects in the region will get a boost.The authority decided that the CZMP will include the eco-sensitive zones (ESZ), if any, and revise the CZMP accordingly, if needed. It also decided that the activities and projects prohibited in the notified ESZ falling within approved CZMP, if any, shall remain prohibited in that area.A clarification on the Flamingo Sanctuary will be issued within a fortnight. This, along with the CZMP, is expected to enable commencement of government schemes, once the announcement is notified.These announcements are likely to bring to a conclusion both of these issues, and enable development of locations within Mumbai and its suburban areas.Realty developers have urged the Maharashtra and central governments to take effective steps to issue the final notification of the eco-sensitive zone around the Thane Creek Flamingo Sanctuary to enable continuity of existing construction activity in Mumbai, Thane, MIDC, Navi Mumbai and Raigad.The central government in its earlier guidelines for the declaration of eco-sensitive zones around 662 protected flora and fauna zones had fixed 10 km as the general norm for determining such zones. Some state governments had objected to this as the formula covered several urban habitations situated close to national parks and sanctuaries.
