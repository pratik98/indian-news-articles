Chennai: As millions of people work-from-home logging on to company networks from devices and internet connections not fully secure, cyber attacks are increasing and getting more nuanced.While phishing scams and malwares playing on people’s vulnerability towards Covid-19 dominated the initial leg of the pandemic induced lockdown, the April-June quarter saw almost doubling of ransomware attacks.Ransomware attack is where the hackers capture access to the enterprise’s data or network and hold it to ransom, in return for money.Seqrite, the cybersecurity brand of Quick Heal Technologies , has detected a 2X surge in ransomware attacks in the June quarter compared to January-March.There were 4 lakh ransomware attacks in April-June 2020 compared to 2 lakh in January-March and 2.3 lakh in the quarter ended June 2019. While the popular Maze ransomware — that impacted operations at IT firm Cognizant — continues to be a top threat, the period also saw emergence of new ransomware families including Ryuk, Mailto, and HorseDeal & Gigabyte, among others.Industry trackers said these attacks are also getting more multi-phased compared to their hitherto ‘hit-and-run’ nature.Himanshu Dubey, director, Quick Heal Security Labs, said the quarter saw increased attacks as companies were forced to speed up their digital transformation efforts and security became a casualty in the process.“We anticipate similar or higher number of attacks in the next couple of quarters. Globally, the pandemic has increased unemployment rate, and we feel this may increase attacks as cyber attacks have now become attacks-as-a-service,” he added.Seqrite also observed increased instances of state-sponsored attacks from neighboring countries like Pakistan and China, he added. The company did not provide details of such attacks.Cybersecurity firm Trend Micro said it blocked 27.8 billion cyber threats in the first half of 2020. “Within Asia, India ranked third for encountering the highest number of email threats with 438 million,” the company said. Trend Micro saw a 36% increase in new ransomware families compared to the same time last year. Barracuda Networks notes increased instances of business email compromise. Around 6,170 malicious accounts that use Gmail, AOL, and other email services have been responsible for over 1,00,000 Business Email Compromise (BEC) attacks in 2020 on nearly 6,600 organisations, a company spokesperson said.In a BEC attack, hackers register email accounts with legitimate email services and use these to impersonate people. As the pandemic accelerated app installs, mobile ad frauds have also seen a spike.App intelligence firm Appsflyer, in its annual mobile ad fraud report, says fraudsters are primarily relying on Bots to fake app installs.“India ranks number one in app install fraud rate in the entertainment vertical, indicating a more targeted and sophisticated approach from fraudsters,” Sanjay Trisal, country manager, AppsFlyer India , said.
