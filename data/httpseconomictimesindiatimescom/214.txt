Bangalore: It’s now 2018, yet the bad memories of 2017 are hard to fade, particularly when it comes to data breaches , virus attacks and dealing with the ever evolving threat landscape.However, in 2018’s first week itself, scientists discovered a major security flaw in the modern microprocessors or computer chips that was exploited by two vulnerabilities known as ‘Meltdown’ and ‘Spectre.’What makes these vulnerabilities more alarming is the fact that it’s found across all chip makers including Intel, AMD (Advance Micro Devices) and ARM.And mind well, it’s just starting of 2018 and so be prepared to deal with more unknown attacks and vulnerabilities as this year unfolds ahead.Given such risky security scenario, the key question most CIOs CISOs , IT heads and security experts today in India and elsewhere are asking is: What sort of security strategy is required in the organisation to prevent cyberattacks?Interestingly the answer lies in the old adage – “Prevention is better than cure” and that’s exactly what Palo Alto Networks’ Vice President Sean Duca , who also is the Regional Chief Security Officer (CSO) for Asia Pacific recommends to Indian CIOs and CISOs.Citing Palo Alto Networks’ State of Cybersecurity in Asia Pacific report 2017, Duca points to one notable thing has come out about India in that report. “There’s definitely, more lean towards detection and response while dealing with security threats in India,” Duca says.“Every security program needs to have an element of detection and response, but I think the question is how to do it,” he argues.Duca rightly backs his argument with the fact that today there’s a very high velocity and volume of threats and so his question is – “Will this detection and response mechanism actually work in preventing cyberattacks?” And obviously the answer is no.Simply relying on detection and response mechanism, according to Duca is no different from walking up to a crime scene and saying something happened here. “Or rather the CIO, CISO, the Board of Directors or executives be saying, how the attacks should be prevented from happening in the first place,” he emphasizes.Referring to last year’s massive ransomware attacks WannaCry and NotPetya that actually had infiltrated some of the major global businesses and crippled its operations, Duca restates the significant role of doing the basics in enhancing security because not every threat is advanced and sophisticated.Many organisations are being compromised today, mainly because of not doing the basics like not patching or updating the software, not using secure passwords or not leveraging two-factor authentication.And that’s where lies the answer to the key question of security strategy and preventing cyberattacks.“Some of the strategies that people need to be thinking are trying and working on preventing anything that we know is known. And for anything that is unknown, we need to leverage automation, so it helps us turn that into a known threat and then try to stop it further down the attack lifecycle itself,” Duca explains.Also there are executives that rely on technology investments alone. To them, Duca says that it’s not just the technology alone, but people, process and technology – are the key and it all works altogether.“From a technology standpoint, people need to think -- why we don’t have a technology that ultimately can prevent attacks from happening to us. And that’s why, data breaches as an example that takes place and there’s no single organisation that could be immune to this,” Duca observes.Relying on old technology or legacy security architecture to deal with today’s modern threats is never going to solve the problems, he further says.While lots of activities are happening on the digital front in India like Digital India initiative led by the government along with private firms, Duca asks this very pertinent question to them—“Are you doing it in a secured way?”Likewise, on the rapid cloud adoption in India, although Duca considers cloud as a great technology with unique benefits, he still thinks there’s a security risk involved in putting data in the cloud. “The big telling point is how I can secure the data that I put in there because they (cloud providers) don’t do that for you,” Duca comments.Going back to the strategic aspect, Duca stresses that there’s a lack of awareness around security and that needs to be increased by constant education around what are the threats, what they look like and so on. He makes his point by giving the example of phishing mails Such mails, according to Duca will not always have those grammatical or spelling errors, but they look something completely legitimate and sophisticated.“But if I can’t stop the user from clicking on that link because I haven’t trained him so how can I reduce the attack surface around that. And that’s something needs to be a boardroom conversation and ultimately people have to execute those conversations,” Duca concludes.
