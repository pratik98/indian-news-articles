The Board of Zee Entertainment on Friday termed the requisition notice sent by two of its public shareholders, Invesco Developing Markets Fund and OFI Global China Fund, calling for an extraordinary general meeting of the company to remove its MD and CEO Punit Goenka as Director, among others, “invalid”, and expressed its inability to hold the EGM.“At its meeting held on October 1, 2021, the Board considered the Requisition Notice. Earlier, the Board obtained written legal advice from the Company's counsel as well as independent legal advice from eminent former judges of the Supreme Court and senior corporate lawyers. After considering the unanimous advice received about the legal validity of the Requisition Notice, the Board deliberated, and unanimously concluded that the Requisition Notice is not valid, as it suffers from multiples legal infirmities…Accordingly, in the best interests of the Company as a whole, including all its shareholders and stakeholders, we express our inability to convene the EGM on the lines requisitioned by you,” the Zee said in a regulatory filing to the stock exchanges.In their letter sent to Zee September 11, Invesco Developing Markets Fund and OFI Global China Fund, holding more than 17 per cent of the shareholding in the company, had sought an EGM to remove MD and CEO Punit Goenka as Director. These public shareholders had further sought resolutions proposing removal of non-executive non-independent directors Ashok Kurien and Manish Chokhani, amid corporate governance issues. Subsequently, these two directors resigned, Zee had informed stock exchanges September 13, 2021, a day before their resolutions for reappointments were to come at the company’s AGM on September 14, 2021. Invesco and OFI Global China had also sought resolutions seeking appointment of six new independent directors.“Your proposal of making fundamental changes to the board of directors and key managerial personnel by seeking removal of the executive director and appointment of six (6) new independent directors will result in noncompliance with the SEBI (Substantial Acquisition of Shares and Takeover) Regulations, 2011 (Takeover Regulations) in as much as you are proposing the appointment of one half of the board without the approval of the Nomination and Remuneration Committee (NRC) and the Board and without following the process laid down under Companies Act and Securities and Exchange Board of India (Listing Obligations and Disclosure Requirements) Regulations, 2 01 5 (SEBI Listing Regulations) for appointment of independent directors. This would result in you effecting a change in control of the Company without making an open offer,” the Zee said.A proposed change of control of this nature would also result in a noncompliance with the Competition Act, 2002, Zee further argued.The Zee’s Board meeting took place on October 1, 2021 after the Mumbai bench of the National Company Law Tribunal had asked the company to consider the requisition of the Invesco Developing Markets Fund and OFI Global China Fund to hold an EGM of the company.
