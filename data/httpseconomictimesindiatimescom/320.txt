Ketan Dalal, MD at advisory firm Katalyst Advisors and noted independent director, in an interview with ETCFO, assessed the state of affairs of corporate governance and the current regulatory framework around it. He emphasised that making laws on the basis that corporate governance is poor across the board is completely contrary to ease of doing business adding that the regulatory regime needs to evolve to strike a balance between quality of disclosure and quantity of disclosure.



The expert has worked closely with regulators / government in several capacities on policy reforms. He is on the Boards of HDFC life insurance co Ltd, Zensar Technologies Ltd and Jio payments bank Ltd. Below are the edited excerpts from the interaction:

The advent of proxy advisory firms and private equity also seems to have played a role in contributing to this enhanced corporate governance. Also, in the last 15 years or so, the younger generation coming into the business with more sophisticated education also seems to have made an impact. .

There is a clearer recognition by independent directors of their responsibilities and the expectations from investors, regulators, analysts, proxy advisory firms, media and indeed, the general public. This is putting a fair bit of pressure on independent directors, and has led to greater involvement and enhancement in quality; of course, some of the expectations and regulations are also unrealistic and need to evolve. .

The enormous risks associated with audits has already led to reluctance of good CAs and other professionals to join the auditing profession, and this will have a long term adverse impact, as we move forward. .

Ketan Dalal: To my mind, corporate governance has improved substantially over the last decade. This can be attributed to a variety of factors, including a significant increase in institutional holding (FII and DFI), fiscal regulations like GST, reduction in corporate tax rates, and indeed, a significant premium on corporate governance in terms of shareholder value.This does not mean frauds will not happen tomorrow. India is a large country and there may be excesses, but chances are that the severity of such cases is likely to be lower in the times to come due to a marked improvement in governance we see today.Also, one needs to remember that several corporate governance issues coming to light recently have had their roots several years ago, in some cases, more than a decade ago; however, the fact that a fraud or a governance issue has surfaced recently, often leads to knee jerk reactions in legislation and regulations.In a nutshell, I believe that there has been significant progress made on corporate governance but it is a process, and corporate India is evolving for the better; but in this context, making laws on the basis that the corporate governance is poor across the board is completely contrary to Ease of Doing Business. Over-prescription is not the answer to corporate governance.Ketan Dalal: I would say many regulations seem to proceed on the presumption that more and more disclosures is an answer to corporate governance. However, one has only to look at the size of the financial statements today to realise that a majority of stakeholders will struggle to understand the content and implications therein, and the regulatory regime seriously needs to evolve to strike a balance between quality of disclosure and quantity of disclosure.As stated earlier, making laws on the basis that the corporate governance is poor across the board is as an outlier approach and has the impact of causing huge compliance issues which badly impact Ease of Doing Business; for example, reference to Benami properties in auditors report, as a mandatory reporting requirement is a good example and one wonders what international investors reading such reports (a vast majority of which will not be negative on such an aspect), will make of such averments in auditors report.Ketan Dalal: Independent directors’ responsibilities have been increasing significantly; whilst the quality and knowledge of independent directors still need improvement overall, there has been a marked improvement, especially in the larger listed companies. The earlier situation of many “independent” directors being friends of promoters is far less prevalent now, than it was earlier.Ketan Dalal: It is difficult to comment on this question without a context and the circumstances in which such resignations occur. Cracks appearing in business is a different issue from issues of governance.In the former situation (example, pressure of cash flows), a director may consider that over a period of time, the company’s future may be impacted and he may believe that it would be difficult for an independent director to add value to a business which may be under strain in the future; on the other hand, in the context of corporate governance, one would also have to take cognisance of the fact as to whether the governance issues have been raised by the concerned director (and, in some form, have been minuted), in which case, having flagged these issues, the independent director may choose to resign because he believes that he is unable to get his point across. On the other hand, a situation of not having raised any issue in the past and abruptly resigning could raise questions as to whether such a director was aware and had chosen to keep quiet, or he had not picked up the issues are all; both of these situations can put the director in a bad light and possibly, the subject of shareholders ire and/or regulatory action.Ketan Dalal: The amount of averments to be made by the auditors, such as vis-a-vis CARO 2020, which comes into effect from this financial year, include aspects such as utilisation of working capital borrowed from banks, and so many other averments, has made the position of auditors extremely difficult and unenviable.The fact that an audit cannot (and is not intended to) guarantee preventing a governance lapse, or that a fraud will always be found by auditors, is something of which there is not much appreciation by the general public, and indeed, by investors.Having said this, there is admittedly very uneven quality in audits; the pressure of costs versus revenue is an issue that the auditing profession, particularly the smaller firms, are grappling with, and quality of resources is a challenge.Ketan Dalal: I wouldn’t say that. Promoters today have become more conscious and are worried that they can be taken to task for gaming the system. Invocation of personal guarantees, personal insolvency processes, and indeed, far less severe, but still quite stringent, such as resolutions for reappointment and/or salaries payments being voted against, are examples that there is an increasing spotlight on promoters and company management.
