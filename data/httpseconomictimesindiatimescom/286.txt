Rajan, who was the governor between 2013 and 2016, had warned of what would happen if the preparations for demonetisation were inadequate. "I was asked by the government in February 2016 for my views on demonetisation.

I made these views known in uncertain terms," Rajan wrote in his book 'I Do What I Do: On Reforms Rhetoric and Resolve'.
