From the Taj Mahal to Qutub Minar, India has elaborate and awe-inspiring heritage buildings as far as architecture and design are concerned. While the historical structures that stand tall to date have unparalleled charm, we have managed to erect some spectacular engineering marvels in recent times too. From the Atal tunnel to the Bandra-Worli sea link bridge, there are excellent examples of what we've achieved, both in terms of technology as well as grandeur.

Now India will soon add another astounding engineering marvel in its cap as Zojila tunnel, Indiaâ€™s longest and highest tunnel at 11,500 feet (3,485 meters), will be inaugurated soon.

High in a rocky Himalayan mountain range in Kashmir, hundreds of people are working on an ambitious project to drill tunnels and construct bridges to connect the Kashmir Valley with Ladakh, a cold desert region isolated half the year because of a massive snowfall. Here's all about Zojila Tunnel that would run between Kashmir and Ladakh.
