Eight in 10 Indian organisations plan to have employees working from home at least once a week in the next 12-24 months, while six in 10 plan to make a permanent move to remote work over the next two years. However, only five in 10 security and business leaders say their organisations are only somewhat or not prepared at all to secure their workforce strategy, finds a new survey.Cyber exposure company Tenable’s global study reveals that 71% of organisations in India attribute recent business-impacting cyberattacks to vulnerabilities in technology put in place in response to the pandemic. The data is drawn from ‘Beyond Boundaries: The Future of Cybersecurity in the New World of Work,’ a commissioned study of more than 1,300 security leaders, business executives and remote employees worldwide, including 92 responses in India, conducted by Forrester Consulting on behalf of Tenable.Specific challenges about supporting a remote workforce include the lack of employee awareness to secure home networks and personal devices (53%) and visibility into employee security practices (56%). Further, only 29% felt that they have enough staff to adequately monitor the attack surface.“Organisations need to eliminate blindspots by shoring up their defenses to support the next phase of their workforce model,” Kartik Shahani, country manager at Tenable India, told ET.“The home network is now the corporate network and the assets that are being used by the end point are not necessarily corporate assets, they may be personal assets, so the hardening of those assets is crucial,” Shahani said.Hybrid work models and a digital-first economy have brought cybersecurity front and centre as a critical investment that can make or break short- and long-term business strategies. To address this demand, Indian security leaders plan to increase cybersecurity investments in vulnerability management (92%), cloud infrastructure and platforms (84%) and identity access management (66%).While the onus is on organisations to strengthen their workforce strategy, employees, too, can help.“One of the easiest and most frequently used methods of injecting ransomware is through spear phishing and that comes through emails, so employees should definitely be careful about what emails they open, as well as not download attachments from senders they’re not sure of,” said Shahani.The online survey of 426 security leaders, 422 business executives, and 479 remote workers, also included telephonic interviews with six business and security executives, to examine cybersecurity strategies and practices at large enterprises in the US, the UK, Germany, France, Australia, Mexico, India, Brazil, Japan, and Saudi Arabia.
