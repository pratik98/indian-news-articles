They used to take the remote access to their computers and infect their systems with malware . Then they would ask for money from the victims in return for help by posing as technical support executives, he added.The spokesperson said the accused also used electronic signatures of the victims for illegal financial gains. These fake call centres would mostly call international citizens and demand their financial and bank details illegally so as to extort money from them."These fake call centres have been identified as Secure Tech Rangreth Srinagar, YSS Micro Technologies Rangreth and Vertex Technology, Karfalli Mohalla Srinagar," he said.According to the spokesperson, fake call centres earn anything between Rs 5 lakh and Rs 20 lakh per day, depending upon the size of their set-up.These scammers mostly cheat people staying in foreign countries by posing as technical support executives, insurance agents, law enforcement officers, bank officials and online shopping site executives, he said.The major issue is that young students are getting attracted to such call centres due to higher salaries. These fake call centres earlier used to be limited to big cities only. However, now they have mushroomed in other parts of the country as well, he said.
