Lucknow: If cyber bullies are harassing or blackmailing you by threatening to post and circulate your morphed pictures and videos on the web, don’t be afraid, seek police help and be assured of action within hours.The new state-of-the-art equipment at the cyber cell of Lucknow Police will now enable the cops to nail and nab the accused in much less time from earlier, when it used to be over 10 days. Besides, there will be more features and tools to crack cybercrime cases.Cyber cell ACP Vivek Ranjan Rai said the new tools will improve investigation and help nab criminals.“In cases of morphed photos, videos we had to be dependent on the policies of social media sites which took several days. But now, the ‘amped software’ will help us enhance morphed videos, photos and even blur images within minutes and trace the sources,” the ACP said.The cyber cell will now use forensic tools to extract mobile data erased from phones and hard disk forensic tools for extracting deleted data from laptops and computers, he added.“We will soon also be able to crack passwords of any desktop or mobile phone using new software,” the ACP said.A proposal has been sent for purchase of ‘chip off technology’ used to extract data of any type from a broken phone, laptop or computer.The new cybercell will now also maintain records and complaints digitally, replacing the manual register.The cyber cell is also launching an awareness drive on cyber frauds.“We will play audios of 50-55 seconds at bus stops, railway stations, Metro stations and create awareness regarding not revealing OTPs, passwords of credit cards, debit cards on call to criminals who call posing as bankers,” said Rai.
