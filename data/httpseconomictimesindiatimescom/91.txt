NEW DELHI: Hendrik Nedeljkovic , managing director of EsyLux Asia expects that commercial lighting segment will drive their growth in coming years. He said that the commercial sector is pretty much growing in India and there are a lot of buildings coming up in the next year in that segment. Edited excerpts:For us the Indian lighting market has progressed very quickly in the transition from traditional lighting to LED lighting . What we are seeing to happen in the future is that automation and lighting controls coming into the picture. Because that's also the next step of achieving energy efficiency and the Indian government is having a lot of initiatives when it comes to sustainability of buildings and respectively the energy efficiency of buildings and it's where we are seeing our brand coming in place.As a solution provider for intelligent lighting and automation we are seeing a big potential in the Indian market within the next coming years because we see that lighting such as traditional lighting industry and automation industry growing together into something that is called smart lighting or intelligent lighting and connectivity of lighting and there is where our strength is.We started about 12 months ago so we are pretty new to the Indian market. We see the potential in India and see it growing not only of their economy but particularly of the lighting as well as smart lighting market segment and as I said it's growing pretty much into smart lighting and into energy efficiency that's where we came in place and why we decided to enter this market.Concerning the Indian market what we think is that the growth potential comparatively to other markets is much bigger here. The transaction from traditional lighting to LED lighting has happened here much faster than another growing economies and in general than another market.So India is in general picking up new technologies much quicker and the initiators promoted by the government in terms of green buildings, sustainability, energy efficiency, we are seeing here that not only the industry itself is advancing quickly but also the government is supporting this growth and that's why we decided the right time and the right place for us to launch our product compared to other emerging markets in the world.We are working in India on a hybrid model where we have a local partner Ipush Innovations who takes care of the office sales market as well as the day-to-day operational cells business, where we are engaging ourselves very much into the market development and into the business development.Our products are mainly manufactured in Germany. We are a German-based company and the same applies here to the products we are selling in India.Our products are innovative so we have technology advantages that Chinese manufacturers don't have. Another critical point is that we are always looking in the total cost of ownership of our products.That means we're not only looking particular in the price of the component itself, but also into installation costs, maintenance costs and thereby our system, smart drivers saves about 60% of the installation time.We are focusing particularly on commercial buildings, offices, the educational segment that includes schools, kindergartens, universities as well as the health care sector.Predominantly our growth, we are expecting, will come from the commercial sector. If you look into the figures, the commercial sector is pretty much growing in India and there's a big amount of buildings coming up in the next year in that segment and we are expecting the biggest growth coming from that segment.Basically, the main development will happen in the biggest cities. Its simply by the nature of the business that they are the commercial centers and as a provider of solutions for the commercial sector we are going hand in hand with the development of the commercial sector.What we are seeing within the next five years definitely it will stay within the major cities and then it really depends on how quick the market is picking up in its development by itself, but it's out of our control but I also believe that smaller cities in India will grow into commercial hubs.What we believe is Indian market is big. A lot of players are there but what we are seeing in the future is that there will be a kind of a separation where you are seeing traditional lighting manufacturers, they will stay on a certain level and then you will have companies going into smart lighting, intelligent lighting and there is really a separation that will happen between companies who have the ability to provide smart, intelligent lighting products to the market and companies who don't and this is what we are seeing globally and this will also happen in India.
