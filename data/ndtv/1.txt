Navjot Sidhu - whose flip-flop this week over the Punjab Congress chief's post has only added to his party's headaches as it preps for next year's key Assembly election - declared Saturday afternoon that "post or no post... (I) will stand by Rahul Gandhi and Priyanka Gandhi Vadra".

Mr Sidhu, backed by the Gandhi family in his bitter feud with former Chief Minister Amarinder Singh (whose resignation last month precipitated a leadership crisis in the state) also vowed to "uphold the principles of Gandhiji and Shastriji" and said he remained committed to ensuring a Congress victory.

"Will uphold principles of Gandhiji and Shastriji... Post or no post will stand by Rahu Gandhi and Priyanka Gandhi! Let all negative forces try to defeat me, but with every ounce of positive energy will make Punjab win, Punjabiyat (Universal Brotherhood) win & every Punjabi win!!" he tweeted.

On Thursday source said Mr Sidhu would remain as President of the Congress' Punjab unit, days after he quit over "no compromise" claims.

He had reportedly been angered by certain appointments made by new Chief Minister Charanjit Singh Channi, including those to the posts of Punjab Police chief and Advocate-General.

The U-turn came after a late-night conversation between Mr Channi and the sulking Mr Sidhu.

"The Congress leadership understands Navjot Sidhu, and Sidhu is not beyond the Congress leadership. He is not Amarinder Singh, who never cared for the Congress and its leadership," the former cricketer's advisor declared. d
