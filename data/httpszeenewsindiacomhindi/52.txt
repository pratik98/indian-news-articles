Born on October 2, 1869, in Porbandar town of Gujarat, Mahatma Gandhi or Mohandas Karamchand Gandhi adopted a non-violent resistance and was at the forefront of the freedom struggle against colonial British rule with utmost patience.

This led to India finally achieving its independence in 1947. Fondly known as Bapu, his unwavering belief in `Swaraj` (self-governance) and `Ahimsa` (non-violence) won him accolades across the world.

Globally, Gandhi`s birth anniversary is celebrated as the International Day of Non-Violence. Several events were held in India and across the world to mark the occasion.
