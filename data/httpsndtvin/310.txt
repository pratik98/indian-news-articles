No coffee lover can miss International Coffee Day. And Kajol, definitely, isn't forgetting to mark the day on her social media page. The actress has given a heads up to her favourite beverage on Instagram. We know that Kajol can turn into a workaholic if her days demand it. But coffee is always by her side. And her appreciation post for coffee also works as a mantra. So what's Kajol's mantra? Kajol's Instagram post shows a throwback photo of herself where she is holding a cup and a saucer. Want to know the essence of this photo? Read Kajol's caption that goes like this, "Coffee - Recharge - Work - Repeat." To complete the note, she added, "Happy International Coffee Day."

Nothing can keep Kajol away from her cup of coffee. She rests her belief in the magic of a good brew. In one post, she wrote, "Everybody should believe in something. I believe I'll go for another round of coffee."

Life is also about having a good time with family and friends. And, no one knows it better than Kajol. Only last week, she celebrated her mother, actress Tanuja's 78th birthday. The celebration featured lots of food and good moments. Kajol's sister, actress Tanishaa Mukherji was also present during the celebrations. Here's Kajol's birthday post for her mother:

Kajol cherishes the times she spends with her family or on her own. The actress loves her work but she also knows the importance of rest and recharge. Here's a post where she says just that. Her caption read, "Relax, Recharge and Reflect. Sometimes it's ok to do nothing. - Izey Victoria Odiase."

On the work front, Kajol was last seen in Renuka Sahane's Netflix film Tribhanga. Tanvi Azmi and Mithila Parkar were also part of the movie.
