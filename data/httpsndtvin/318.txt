Alaya Furniturewalla is making Maldives look so stunning that we need to sit down for a breather. Co-ord sets have been essential summer fits that easily slip into any occasion, holiday or dinner dates. We say this with evidence of course. Anyone who goes to Maldives is smitten by its gorgeous seascapes but when you have a feisty co-ord set to up the style game, you can steal all the limelight. That's exactly what Alaya Furniturwalla did in her striped set that made her Maldives holiday so good from the very start. The three piece set is proof that yes, a stylish swimsuit to the beach is essential but so is a co-ord set, summer holiday's hottest new stylish staple.

But it has to be her touch down to the gorgeous beach holiday that stole the show for us. Whoever said bright bikinis are the next big thing need to stop and consider a white bikini set asap because there is no way on earth we'd trade this all-white bikini look for anything else.

Sure it does feel like freedom when you're at the beach, right? We kid you not, Alaya Furniturewala also approves and we'd be lying if we said we don't want a beach holiday anytime soon. Alaya Furniturewala also makes for a chic case for cutout swimsuits while at it.
