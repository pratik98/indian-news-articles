Smriti Mandhana 127 216 22 1 58.79

c Tahlia McGrath b Ashleigh Gardner 68.1 OUT! CAUGHT! Finally, Australia have picked the wicket and it is off the big one, Smriti Mandhana! End of a very good innings from the left-hander and she walks off to a round of applause. Tossed up on off, Mandhana uses her feet and then looks to drive but she does not get to the pitch of the ball and ends up playing it uppishly to cover where Tahlia McGrath takes the catch. Can Australia make a comeback from here? Mithali Raj is the next batter in. 195/2 75.93% DotBall

c Tahlia McGrath b Sophie Molineux 25.1 OUT! TAKEN! There is the wicket Australia desperately needed! Shafali Verma's luck runs out and Sophie Molineux finally gets her. The Aussies built the pressure in the last few overs, they did not let India score freely and that has brought about the wicket. This is tossed up, it is fuller and on off, Verma looks to go over mid off but there is no timing on it. It lobs to the fielder there where Tahlia McGrath takes an easy catch. Can this be the opening the Aussies needed? 93/1 75% DotBall

Poonam Raut 36 165 2 0 21.81

c Alyssa Healy b Sophie Molineux 80.4 OUT! TAKEN! Raut has walked! Excellent from her, the umpire did not give her out but she knew she had hit it and she just starts walking back. The move to not take the second new ball has worked as Sophie gets the well-set Raut. Lovely nut. It lands on off and then spins away. Raut looks to defend, initially it seemed like she was beaten. The keeper and the bowler put in half an appeal, the umpire shakes his head but Raut starts walking back. A new batter now out with the second new ball being available. Can Australia take another one before the break? 217/3 85.45% DotBall

run out (Annabel Sutherland) 98.1 OUT! RUN OUT! Raj is short by just! She has been run out for the second time in this series. Once in the second ODI and now here. Brilliant from Annabel Sutherland! This is on middle, Raj works it towards mid-wicket. She wants one and is halfway down the wicket but is sent back. She slips as she tries to turn, hence, it takes a little longer than it would have for her to get back. Annabel Sutherland from mid-wicket, runs to the ball, picks it up and fires it on the stumps at the keeper's end. They refer it and replays show that that slip costs her. All of a sudden India are 5 down now. 274/5 84.88% DotBall

Yastika Bhatia 19 40 3 0 47.50

c Beth Mooney b Ellyse Perry 92.5 OUT! TAKEN! Beth Mooney hangs on this time! That is a superb catch from her! Perry looks back at the umpire just to confirm that is it a no ball but it is a legal delivery which comes as a big relief for her. She gets her first. Well-deserved, this is a brilliant spell from her. This is on the pads, Bhatia looks to flick but the ball moves away. It goes off the leading edge towards gully where Mooney dives forward and takes it just above the ground. Bhatia's stay is not a long one, she looked classy till the time she was out but could not make most of the start. 261/4 80% DotBall

lbw b Stella Campbell 143.4 OUT! LBW! Deepti Sharma has to walk back as Stella Campbell strikes yet again! This was a good-length ball, around middle and leg. Deepti Sharma looks to pull it but the ball keeps a bit low and she misses. The ball hits her low on her pad and Campbell appeals. The umpire raises his finger in no time. The replays show that the ball was pitching outside leg and it was Not Out. 369/8 76.65% DotBall

c Alyssa Healy b Stella Campbell 126.2 OUT! CAUGHT BEHIND! What a moment for Stella Campbell. She picks her first Test cricket wicket. Australia Women worked hard to get a wicket and finally gets the breakthrough. The partnership which was blossoming has now been broken. Coming to the ball, Stella Campbell bowls a good-length ball, outside off, nipping away. Taniya Bhatia stays deep in the crease and has a poke at it. The ball goes off the outside edge and Alyssa Healy behind the stumps does the rest. 319/6 88% DotBall

c Beth Mooney b Ellyse Perry 142.3 OUT! TAKEN! Ellyse Perry picks up her 300th wicket in all formats. But this wicket belongs to Beth Mooney. Perry delivers a length ball, outside off. Pooja Vastrakar is tempted to play the cover drive and goes after it. The ball kisses the outside edge and flies towards the second slip where Beth Mooney dives to her left and takes the catch. An excellent catch from her. Pooja Vastrakar has to walk back to the pavilion. THAT WILL BE DINNER ON DAY 3. 359/7 85.42% DotBall
