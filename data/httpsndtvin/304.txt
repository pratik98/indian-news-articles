"Here, Shiva is called Somnath, or Chandrashekhar," he wrote

Milind Soman and Ankita Konwar have been adding new pictures every day to their Gujarat diaries since the week started. The couple spent their whole day at the Somnath Temple on Thursday, pictures of which Milind Soman even shared on his Instagram profile. "They say that the moon god, Chandra, was sheltered by Shiva in his hair at this spot, to save him from King Daksha's curse, the curse makes the moon wane and Shiva's blessing makes it full again!! That's why, here, Shiva is called Somnath, or Chandrashekhar. Am sure there are many other wonderful stories that you have heard too. Jai Bhole Nath! His blessings on you all!" he wrote in his caption and added: "Spent the whole day with Ankita at this ancient and sacred place, from the time it opened its gates in the morning, till after dinner."
