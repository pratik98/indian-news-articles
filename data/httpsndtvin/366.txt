Rohit Sharma 7 10 1 0 70

c Kagiso Rabada b Avesh Khan 1.5 OUT! Rohit holes out! Here is the first breakthrough and Avesh Khan continues to pick wickets this season. Serves a shortish delivery outside off, at 131.7 kph, there is some extra bounce again as Rohit winds up for a big shot across the line. It takes the top edge and flies behind backward point. Kagiso Rabada moves across to his right from third man and takes the skier safely. Plenty of dot balls and it frustrated the batsman. Good bowling. 8/1 70% DotBall

Quinton de Kock 19 18 1 1 105.55

c Anrich Nortje b Axar Patel 6.2 OUT! CAUGHT! Axar Patel gets rid of Quinton de Kock. De Kock cannot believe what he has done here and Mumbai lose their second wicket. De Kock once again gets a start and gets out. Loopy ball outside off, de Kock looks to go over the off side but gets a thick outside edge to backward point. Anrich Nortje takes a simple catch there and Axar is happy. 37/2 50% DotBall

Suryakumar Yadav 33 26 2 2 126.92

c Kagiso Rabada b Axar Patel 10.3 OUT! CAUGHT! Axar Patel is having a great run and is continuing. This is a pretty soft dismissal though for Suryakumar Yadav and he will be disappointed with the execution of this shot. Axar dishes out a full toss on middle, Yadav looks to go over long on but gets it off the toe end of the bat. Kagiso Rabada comes running in from long on and takes a good catch. This was a delivery that should have been put away but Yadav gifts his wicket away instead. 68/3 34.62% DotBall

Saurabh Tiwary 15 18 1 0 83.33

c Rishabh Pant b Axar Patel 12.5 OUT! Axar Patel strikes again! Loose shot from Saurabh Tiwary! Mumbai needed to consolidate and they have lost another wicket at the wrong time. Patel bowls a floated ball outside off, skidding further away, Tiwary looks to swipe it across the line but it takes the top edge and goes to the side of the pitch on the off side. Rishabh Pant calls for it and takes it comfortably. Mumbai are in a slight spot of bother here. 80/4 33.33% DotBall

Kieron Pollard 6 9 0 0 66.66

b Anrich Nortje 14.1 OUT! DRAGGED ON! What a great start to Nortje's second spell as they get the big, big wicket of Pollard! The big West Indian has bailed Mumbai out of trouble on so many occasions but he will not be able to do the same in this clash. Anrich Nortje starts with a slower length delivery, outside off, it does not rise too much as Pollard looks to push this to the off side. The ball takes the inside edge and goes onto clip the leg pole. Half the Mumbai side is back into the shed and Delhi continue to stay on top. 87/5 33.33% DotBall

Hardik Pandya 17 18 2 0 94.44

b Avesh Khan 18.1 OUT! TIMBER! OHHHHH! What a cracking delivery and Khan gets rid of the dangerous man. There was nothing that Hardik Pandya could do about that. Khan runs in and spears a laser-guided yorker, around middle and leg, at 141.3 clicks. Hardik Pandya looks to whip it but he misses. He hears the death rattle behind him. Khan gets his second of the game and starts his last over very well! 109/6 44.44% DotBall

b Avesh Khan 18.4 OUT! BOWLED 'EM! Another one for him. This man is on fire and he continues to impress. It is such a crucial juncture in the game but nothing can unnerve Khan. His third wicket. A pacy delivery this time, around off, on a length at 140 kph, Nathan Coulter-Nile looks to whack this across the line but fails to connect. The ball crashes into the off pole. Delhi are closing things out well. 111/7 50% DotBall

Jayant Yadav 11 4 1 1 275

c Steven Smith b Ravichandran Ashwin 19.2 OUT! TAKEN! Easily done and Yadav's short burst has come to an end. He has done what was needed from him though. This one was fuller, but wider outside off, Jayant Yadav looks to lift this one over extra cover but mistimes it. Steven Smith, who was present there inside the ring, times his jump to perfection and gobbles this one up. 122/8 25% DotBall
