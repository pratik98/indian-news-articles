Neeraj performed brilliantly in the Olympics and was simply untouchable from the qualifying round to the final.

The 23-year-old started with a brilliant throw of 86.65m in the first attempt itself as he sealed a spot for the final round.

He went on to better his qualifying throw and registered distances of 87.03m and 87.58m.

Germany's Johannes Vetter, who was tipped as the favourite to win the gold after his 94.20m throw at World Athletics Tour earlier in the year, failed in the final round.

Apart from Neeraj's gold, India won six more medals, including two silver and four bronze.

Weightlifter Mirabai Chanu won silver in the women's 49 kg category while PV Sindhu won a bronze in women's badminton singles.
