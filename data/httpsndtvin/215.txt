Don't look up, because a comet is earth-bound. The teaser of Netflix movie Don't Look Up dropped like a bomb... scratch that... dropped like a comet from space, on Wednesday. Written and directed by Adam McKay, Don't Look Up looks like another space disaster flick but with a stellar cast and double the intrigue. Don't Look Up casts Leonardo DiCaprio and Jennifer Lawrence as two "low-level" astronomers, who, to their dismay, have figured out that a comet is Earth-bound, one that will destroy what humankind call their home. Following their discovery, Leonardo and Jennifer try to warn everyone around the world with a media tour and they end up landing in the President's office.

Meryl Streep, who plays the role of President, do not of course take the two astronomers seriously when they voice their concern - one that can destroy Earth. Jonah Hill, who plays the President's son and Chief Of Staff, laughs it off, saying: "So boring!" The trailer begins with Leonardo DiCaprio gasping for breath as he appears to have had an anxiety attack over the impending danger. "Your breathing is stressing me out," Jonah Hill tells him in another scene.
