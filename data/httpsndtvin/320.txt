Co-ord sets have been essential summer fits that easily slip into any occasion, holiday or dinner dates. We say this with evidence of course. The evidence being Raai Laxmi who made dinner dates with her girlfriends a stylish affair with an olive green co-ord set on. The co-ord set was super edgy and versatile and we can totally imagine her wearing the separates in many unique ways too. The crop top cinches at the waist perfectly but it is the flounced culottes that stole the show for us. The genius pairing of the co-ord set with a multicolour necklace is proof that for the upcoming festive season too, such co-ords are the perfect fusion pieces. A pair of Valentino Garavani Rockstud heels worth Rs 75K elevated the glam quotient further to begin the weekend on a stylish note.

Raai Laxmi in the city

If her dinner dates look this stylish, her red carpets must be a treat to the eyes, no? She certainly does not disappoint and recently at the SIIMA Awards 2021, she spelled royalty in a dramatic royal blue Shantanu & Nikhil gown with statement sleeves and cutouts.

But if there is one thing Raai Laxmi does have a special place for then that is lathering up sunscreen and basking under the sun in stylish bikinis. Colourful styles, vibrant prints and everything we'd imagine this summer stunner to love.
