Venkatesh Iyer 67 49 9 1 136.73

c Deepak Hooda b Ravi Bishnoi 14.4 OUT! CAUGHT! Venkatesh Iyer got the right connection on this, but, didn't get the desired elevation and distance. Ravi Bishnoi gets his second and Punjab get rid of Iyer, who was looking in top form. Bishnoi floats this one up, lands it fuller and wide outside off, Venkatesh Iyer goes down and across and looks to clear the deep mid-wicket fence, with a slog-sweep. But he hits it flat and straight towards Deepak Hooda. Another catch for him. 120/3 30.61% DotBall

b Arshdeep Singh 2.2 OUT! CLEANED HIM UP! 'Balle balle' for Singh very early on! Kolkata are one down very quickly. Arshdeep has impressed every single time he is handed the ball and he starts off with a bang on this occasion too. On a good length, around off, slanting away, Gill looks to push this to the off side but the ball takes the inside edge and crashes onto the furniture behind. Just the start that Punjab would have wanted! 18/1 42.86% DotBall

Rahul Tripathi 34 26 3 1 130.76

c Deepak Hooda b Ravi Bishnoi 11.3 OUT! TAKEN! Ravi Bishnoi strikes and Punjab finally get the wicket that they were waiting for! Rahul Tripathi tries to force the issue this time but it proves to be his undoing. Bishnoi serves this fuller, loopy, around off, Rahul Tripathi gets low and tries to mow a slog-sweep towards the deep mid-wicket region. It goes high in the air off the top edge and hence fails to get the required distance. Deepak Hooda runs across to his right from long on and ensures that this stand is broken. Punjab will look to build on this breakthrough. 90/2 34.62% DotBall

Nitish Rana 31 18 2 2 172.22

c Mayank Agarwal b Arshdeep Singh 17.4 OUT! CAUGHT! End of the Rana show this evening. Slower one does the trick for Arshdeep Singh. Short in length, around off at 116.9 kph, Nitish Rana probably picks it but still has not managed to generate enough power behind his attempted pull shot. It flies to the deep and Mayank Agarwal takes the catch safely near the fence, at deep mid-wicket. 149/5 22.22% DotBall

Eoin Morgan 2 2 0 0 100

lbw b Mohammed Shami 15.5 OUT! Morgan is trapped in front! His sorry form is refusing to leave him. Shami keeps it nice and straight, fuller in length, Morgan walks across the stumps for a cheeky paddle shot probably. He is late into the shot though, misses the ball and is rapped on the pads. The appeal is made and the finger has gone up almost immediately. Dead plumb. 124/4 50% DotBall

b Arshdeep Singh 20 OUT! TIMBER! What a fantastic last over by Arshdeep Singh! Serves it very full and in the line of the stumps at 135.9 kph, Dinesh Karthik walks way too across the stumps as he tries to play the paddle shot. Ends up missing the ball and finds his stumps shattered. Kolkata finish on 165/7! 165/7 27.27% DotBall

Tim Seifert 2 4 0 0 50

run out (Mohammed Shami) 18.4 OUT! This time it's a run out and Tim Seifert will have to depart. A near-yorker just outside off, Tim Seifert tries to be adventurous with his reverse-batted shot but misses. He is hit on the boot and the ball deflects on the leg side. Shami appeals but then realizes that the batsmen are looking to steal a run. He immediately attacks the ball, picks it up, turns and scores a direct hit at the bowler's end to find Tim Seifert short. Great athleticism shown by the fast bowler. 156/6 50% DotBall
