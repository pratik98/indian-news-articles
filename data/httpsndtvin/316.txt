Even if Nora Fatehi were to wear a basic workout look, wait, who are we kidding, there is no such thing as that. Even a stroll is as fashionable an excuse as one of her movie promotions. Obviously then, her gym workouts weren't one to spare then, right? Heading to the gym and heading to the gym in style are two very different things and even though we're failing at either, Nora Fatehi fits the bill just the right. She marched to the gym in a bright pink sports bra and black gym tights which on any given day would make the cut at any workout session. Her limited edition Christian Dior tote handbag worth Rs 3.8 Lakh however caught our eye. Did you really think she would head to the gym without one of her designer handbags from her extensive collection?
