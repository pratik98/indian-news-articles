Wow, Tanishaa Mukerji, just wow. The actress, on Friday, set the Internet on fire by sharing two stunning pictures of herself chilling by the pool and we can't even. Tanisha, who was on a vacation with her mom Tanuja and sister, looks every bit of gorgeous in a beige swimsuit in the pictures. The first one is in the shadow while the other one features the actress basking in the sun. Sharing the pictures, Tanishaa borrowed a quote by Osho: "'You become silent, everything has calmed down, just like the Ganges when it comes to the plains. In the hills it is roaring like a lion, falling from great heights into depths, much turmoil; and then it comes to the plains, leaves the hills. Now the terrain changes, now everything flows silently. You cannot even see whether it is flowing or not; everything moves as if it is not moving, at ease. Attain to inner accomplishment, innate, with no hope: not going to any goal, not in any hurry, no haste, just enjoying each moment. ...like the Ganges, it flows on slow and gentle.' - osho."
